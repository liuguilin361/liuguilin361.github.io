But how do I do that? I know that there are some crates that provide a nice API for one-time initialized static variables. But how do they work under the hood? And are they the best solution? Let's find out!\nNaive Solution\nOne solution would be to don't cache the value at all. This will serve as a baseline for the other solutions. We'll use the CPUID instruction as an example value which should be cached, as I'm also using it to detect CPU features in my hypervisor. I wanted to keep the benchmark as close as possible to the real use case to not fall into any traps.\nWe can define the benchmark function as follows:\n\nBenchmark\nLet's benchmark it using criterion.\n28ns is quite fast, but what if we have an instruction that takes much longer? What if we want to log the value or have to do heavy computations? This would slow it down a lot. Let's see if we can do better.\n\nOnceCell\nLike any good programmer, my second solution was to use the most popular crate I could find on the web: once_cell. It provides a very simple API to create a lazy static variable. We'll be using the calc_value function from the previous example.\n\nHow it's implemented\nThe implementation of OnceCell is quite interesting because it's based on atomic operations to ensure thread safety. It has an unsafe cell (used for interior mutability) and an atomic state. The state is used to ensure that the value is only initialized once.\n\nThey built a very nice and easy-to-use API on top of it which explains the popularity of the crate.\n\n\nBenchmark\nThe solution is quite straightforward, but how does it perform?\n\nNot bad. It takes on average around 215ps to get the value. That's already a 140x speedup. But can we do better?\nlazy_static\nLet's check out another equally popular crate: lazy_static. It provides a macro that allows us to create a lazy static variable.\n\nHow it's implemented\nlazy_static uses the Once synchronization primitive from the spin crate. The Once primitive can be used to call a function exactly once (as the name suggests):\n\nThe implementation under the hood is very similar to once_cell. We have a status, an unsafe cell for the data and a phantom data.\n\nWith this primitive, one can easily implement the container for the data behind the lazy_static macro. Add some syntactic sugar and we have a very nice API.\n\nBenchmark\nSince the synchronization primitives used under the hood are so similar to once_cell, the performance is also very similar with 320ps on average.\n\nAtomics\nIf you look back at the code of once_cell and lazy_static, you will notice that they both use atomic operations to ensure thread safety. But what are atomic operations and how do they work? Let's find out!\nWhat are they?\nAtomics behave the same way as normal operations (read, write, add, sub, etc.) but they come with further guarantees. They ensure that the operation is executed atomically, meaning that no other thread can access the memory location at the same time. They also provide the option to specify memory ordering.\nWhat the hell is Memory Ordering?\nCompilers and CPUs are allowed to reorder memory accesses for performance reasons (out-of-order-execution). By using Atomics, we can specify the order in which memory accesses should be executed.\nInstruction reordering might not be an issue for simple programs, but it can lead to very subtle bugs in concurrent programs. Let's take this example (taken from the to Rust Atomics and Locks book by Mara Bos):\n\nThe CPU can execute these instructions in any order. Possible outputs are:\n\n0 0: Thread B reads the values before Thread A was able to write them.\n10 0: Thread A writes X, then Thread B reads both.\n10 20: Thread A writes X and Y, then Thread B reads both.\n0 20: Thread A writes Y before X, then Thread B reads both.\n\nHow can this lead to issues? Let's take a look at this example:\n\nIf two programs execute the conditional check at the same time, then they'll both try to lock and store the value. The solution: Different memory orderings.\nIn Rust, there's a non_exhaustive enum called Ordering which specifies allowed orderings.\n\nOrdering::Relaxed: No guarantees, can be reordered freely.\nOrdering::Release (store) and Ordering::Acquire (load): When used together, they form a lock. No memory stored after Release and no reads before Acquire. This is the most common use case for atomics. This achieves a happens-before relationship between the two threads (Release is always executed before Acquire).\n\n\n\nOrdering::AcqRel (load-with-store): Represents both Acquire and Release. Used for compare_exchange and other operations that do both.\nOrdering::SeqCst: Like Acquire/Release/AcqRel (for load, store, and load-with-store operations, respectively) but with additional guarantees.\n\nAtomics are a complex topic and I can't cover everything in this post. If you want to learn more about it, I can recommend the video Crust of Rust: Atomics and Memory Ordering by Jon Gjengset and the Rust Atomics and Locks book by Mara Bos.\nHow it's implemented\nCompareExchange\nWith all the theory covered, let's try to implement a cache using compare_exchange. For the sake of simplicity, we'll use Ordering::Relaxed for all operations. This is safe because in the worst case, we'll just compute the value twice.\nThe function compare_exchange compares the first argument with the value in the atomic and replaces it with the second argument if they are equal. It returns a Result which indicates whether the value was replaced or not.\n\nYou might think: \"Wait, why do we need to load the value again? We just replaced it!\". The reason is that compare_exchange returns the old value. So we need to load it again to return it.\nThe compare_exchange function is usually used for Mutexes to check whether the lock is already taken and then acquire it. So it might not be the ideal solution, but we'll see how it performs in the benchmark.\n\nLoad/Store\nSince we need a load operation anyway, we can also use load and store instead of compare_exchange.\n\n\nBenchmark\nTurns out that compare_exchange is a very expensive operation. The retrieval of the cached value takes 34ns on average, which is significantly slower than the previous solutions. It is even slower than the naive solution without caching which took 28ns on average.\n\nIn contrast, the load/store solution is very fast with 230ps on average. This is because the CPU can optimize the load/store operations very well (more on that later).\n\nStatic Mutability\nLet's ignore everything we learned about atomics and memory orderings and just use a static mutable variable. This is not thread-safe, but we'll just ignore that for now. This is not an issue for my use case, because I don't have many threads running at the same time when the value is initialized.\n\n\nBenchmark\nTurns out that this solution generates the same assembly instructions as the load/store solution. Thus the performance is also the same at 230ps on average.\n\nWhy is load/store the same as unsafe-static?\nOn x86 CPUs, all memory operations have the ordering of AcqRel so we don't need to specify it explicitly. The compiler also knows this, so all atomic operations can be optimized to much faster mov instructions.\nComparing the code on Compiler Explorer, we can see that there's absolutely no difference between the two solutions.\n\n\n\nComparing all solutions\nTurns out, it doesn't matter which crate or option we choose as long as we don't use the compare_exchange implementation. I'd suggest using once_cell or lazy_static because they provide a nice API and are easy to use.\nHowever, one could benefit from the unsafe static approach when writing code for a platform that has a different default memory ordering (RISC-V or ARM).\n\nI thought there would be a bigger difference between the different solutions. But once_cell, lazy_static and load-store are almost equally as fast.\n\nI also used the microbench crate to get a better overview of the performance. The results are similar to the ones from criterion:\n\nYou can find the benchmarks here.\nConclusion\nHere are some takeaways from this benchmark:\n\nCompare against dumb solution: It's really easy to implement and can reveal some interesting insights (like the compare_exchange solution being slower than the dumb solution).\nKeep it close to the real world: Don't try to benchmark the calculation of 2 + 2, but rather something close to your use case. In my case, this was the CPUID instruction.\nAvoid premature optimizations: Most of the time, you won't benefit from reducing the time from 28ns to 200ps, even though it sounds impressive. Don't optimize prematurely, and don't bother optimizing one-time costs. The gist Achieving warp speed with Rust has very useful tips for benchmarking.\n\nHowever, I believe it was worth it in my case because I was actually using compare_exchange. It's always useful to have benchmarks to back up your decisions.\n\n\nUse once_cell or lazy_static\n\n\nI really enjoyed working on this benchmark. I was able to refresh my knowledge about memory orderings and atomics.

When a friend convinced me to enable it, I did the first few challenges, but quickly noticed that they are really repetitive.\nSo I did the only reasonable thing: Automate it. My friend used puppeteer to automate the tasks, but I decided to go through their source code and find the code that handles those achievements.\n\nWhere to start?\nWhen you've only got a UI, it's always hard to know where to start. There are a bunch of places to look. Since Discord uses Electron we can either look through the files on disk or in the browser.\nWe'd only go for the first option, if we know that the feature can only be accessed on the desktop application. An example for that would be the Discord overlay. But since the party mode also works in the browser, we can start there.\nAfter inspecting the HTML elements for the party mode, I couldn't see any references to any JavaScript functions. I also checked the networking tab, but there were no outgoing or incoming requests. Finally, I checked the console but there was also no output.\nSince all our attempts didn't bring us closer to figuring out how the party mode works, let's try something else.\nDiscord has an asset folder with all their bundled code. The bundler compiles all the JavaScript files, minifies and sometimes even obfuscates them. Luckily, these are just minified, so we can right-click on the assets folder and search all the files in it.\n\nWe can now search for certain keywords and see what comes up. I tried keywords like party, combo, confetti and found the according file pretty quickly.\nReverse Engineering it\nThere are a bunch of references, that just contain mappings like these. They aren't really useful to us, because they are just mapping certain variables to their HTML identifiers.\n\nBut there's also another file (78a38cf0ea7963a0711a.js), that handles the party mode logic. Just by looking at the strings and variable names, we can already guess what it's doing. For example, what do you think this code does?\n\nIf you know what achievements there are, you'll immediately recognize that this is the array that stores some data about them. And when scrolling down a little, you'll find exactly 19 blocks of code that all look somewhat like this:\n\nThere's even one legendary achievement that has an event handler. Can you guess which video they are opening?\n\nSo now we know where the achievement logic is located, can we figure out whether it's stored? I initially did some achievements by hand on the Desktop client, but when I opened the browser client, all of them were gone. Since there were also no outgoing or incoming requests when looking at the networking, we can be certain that the data is just stored locally.\nYou could now either go through the file and search for references to storage APIs or look through LocalStorage. Since there's not that many options, the PoggermodeAchievementStore key might stand out. When you look at the stored value, you can clearly see the unlocked achievements. Nice!\n\nPatching it\nNow that we know where the achievements are stored, we can easily modify it. I wanted to write a simple JavaScript program for that, but for whatever reason, window.localStorage wasn't defined. So instead of wasting more time to find a workaround, I decided to manually replace it.\nSince we already found the achievement array, we know that there's 19 of them. We can just write it out like this and replace the value. The dateUnlocked value is a epoch timestamp. You can create your own timestamp on this website.\n\nAfter reloading the client, we got all the achievements. Now I can brag to all of you about how cool I am. :)\n\nWhat did we learn?\nThis was only a small project, but we still learned quite a lot. We now know how we can start reversing websites or Electron applications. I'm using Firefox for all my personal browsing, but I decided to spin up Chrome because I know how good their DevTools are. So make sure to use the right tool for the job.\n\nI'm a big fan of structured procrastination and learning new things by starting a project. So if you catch yourself procrastinating or wasting time, try to turn it into a fun side project.\nAfter all, it is never a waste of time to learn something new.\n","id":"https://liuguilin361.github.io/posts/discord-party-mode/","title":"Reverse Engineering Discord's Party Mode"},"https://liuguilin361.github.io/posts/first-year-of-uni/":{"body":"I read a blog post with this exact same title by the Heep. And since I also finished my first year of university a few months ago, I wanted to reflect on it as well.\nThe beginning\nIt all started one week before classes started. I decided to attend a guided tour of the campus, so that I'd be better prepared. I can't imagine where I would be right now if I didn't get out of bed that day. I found like-minded people also studying Computer Science. We explored the campus on our own and grabbed a coffee. University hadn't even started, and I had already made friends. We exchanged numbers and were well-prepared for the start.\nWe were a small group with roughly 10 people. Over the year, more and more joined. Our discord currently has 40 members. None of us could've ever imagined this. Having that many people around is incredibly useful when discussing exams and homework. There'll always be someone who understands a complex topic or exercise.\nHere's what I love about our group:\n\nDiscussions are different: Normally when you are discussing something, you'd want to prove your point to the other person. In our group, it's completely different. Everyone is open-minded and accepts that they might be missing some information. A good friend mentioned this quote and I think it fits: \"There are things that you know, things you don't know and things you don't know that you don't know.\"\nConversations: We can talk about everything. Doesn't matter if it's technical areas, money, relationships, mental health, fitness, or something else.\nGrowth mindset: Our group constantly tries to challenge the status quo and encourage the discussion of ideas. Being part of our group means having a growth mindset.\nKnowledge: Since we have a lot of members, there's quite a lot of diversity. We have experts in many different fields. This makes the discussions an incredible learning experience.\n\nSince everyone is so knowledgeable, we encourage sharing their wisdom via presentations. In the beginning it was just for our group, but we are planning to change that. A few of us got together and founded a society called 0xA. Our goal is to share knowledge via blog posts and presentations. If you are interested, feel free to join our discord:\n\n    \n\nUniversity\nBefore university even had started, I already tried to prepare. I read books, watched videos, read articles. It was fascinating to learn about concepts like Spaced Repetition or Active Recall and to see what works for other people, but I didn't use a lot of it during the year.\nI'm not going to go into detail of what we did, there's a website for that. I've linked to it if you want to find out more about a course.\nHere's the list of all the courses I did in the last year:\n\nLogic\nFormal Models\nDiscrete Structures\nAlgebra\nPractical Training in Software Development 2\nSoftware Development 2\nOperating Systems\nElectronics\nDigital Circuits\nMultimedia Systems\nEthics and Gender Studies\n\nBefore university, I went to a Higher Technical College where I already learned programming. That's why I got some courses credited. This allowed me to prepone other courses that I found interesting.\n\nCompiler Construction:\n\nWrote a rant blog post about one feedback I got in this course: https://not-matthias.github.io/posts/why-java-doesnt-optimize/\n\n\nSystems Programming\nLaw for Computer Science\nComputer Graphics\nTechniques of Presentation and Team Work\n\nI'm still amazed how much content you cover at university compared to school. Not all courses are perfect, but at least the lecturers are open for feedback. My favorite classes were Compiler Construction and Computer Graphics. I already knew the basics, but got the chance to dive deeper into the subject.\nHere's what I liked most in some courses:\n\nSmall quizzes instead of big exam: With this system you have to study a little every week and will potentially get a better grade since you are less likely to procrastinate. I really like this system, because it's similar to the 1% rule.\nGroup exercises: This is a lot more fun (assuming your partners don't drop out after one week).\nYou'll always learn something new: I thought I already knew quite a lot about operating systems and programming, yet there's always something else that I had never heard of. You never know what you don't know. ;)\nProjects: When you work on projects, you learn a lot more and have something to show off at the end.\n\nSome tips from my side on the things that I would repeat:\n\nFind group partners in advance: We had a few group exercises. Find your partners in advance, so that you don't have to work on the assignment/project the night before. The final submission will be much better if everyone contributed the same amount of time.\nFind a group of like-minded people: Create a Discord and Signal group for discussions. Discuss exercises and lectures, but also have fun and go out and party.\n\nWhere can you find these people? You can attend introductory events or just talk to them after a lecture.\n\n\nExperiment and take risks: I had a presentation in a seminar that consisted 80% out of memes. It worked out really well, and I learned a lot during the process. So if you want to learn a new programming language or experiment with something, why not turn it into a project? Be creative and take risks.\nUniversity ⊂ Life: University is a subset of your life, but it shouldn't be your entire life. Have fun and attend some parties.\nStudy exams from previous years: It'll give you an idea what the professor wants you to know. There's also a high chance that they are using one or two questions from the previous years.\nAlways do all the exercises: It's a good preparation and will save you a lot of study time later on.\nDiscuss exams with others: Whenever there's an upcoming exam, we would arrange a meeting on our Discord server to go through the exams from the previous years and discuss them as a group. Sometimes the correct answers aren't displayed, which makes this even more important.\nJoin clubs: There aren't that many clubs at my university, but I highly recommend to join them. I joined our university CTF team SIGFLAG and participated in some events. It was alot of fun.\n\nFinal words\nFrom the 13 years of education I had before, this year has been the most life-changing. I'm grateful for the support of my friends as I've navigated this new chapter in my life. I'm looking forward to the next year as I continue to grow and learn.\nThanks for reading.\n","id":"https://liuguilin361.github.io/posts/first-year-of-uni/","title":"Reflecting on the first year of Uni"},"https://liuguilin361.github.io/posts/hacking-a-silent-disco/":{"body":"Introduction\nA while ago while I was partying at a silent disco bar, I noticed something interesting: They have a digital jukebox - basically a website that lets people choose which music should be played. People can add songs or vote for existing ones. The song with the most votes will be played next.\nI tried to add my own song, but I didn't get any votes so I did the only logical thing: I reverse engineered the website and wrote a bot to vote for my song.\n\nHow does it work?\nLet's take a step back. How does the Jukebox even work? It's quite straightforward. You go to the website and add the song you want or vote for other songs:\n\nReverse Engineering it\nSince it's a web app, the first thing I looked at was the network requests. I quickly realized, they are using websockets, since I saw no network requests when voting. After finding the wss://s-usc1f-nss-2524.firebaseio.com/.ws?v=5&amp;ns=festify-79b08 websocket request, I was able to view all the messages:\n\nThe JSON data looked strange, and only parts made sense so I searched for it on the internet. I then found out that they are using a Firebase Realtime Database to store the data.\nFirebase Realtime Database Wire Protocol\nTurns out, the websocket is part of the undocumented Firebase Wire Protocol. Luckily, some people have already reverse engineered it and documented some parts. Why? Writing a custom backend is useful when Google could kill Firebase tomorrow and add it to their graveyard.\nEncoding\nAll the websocket messages are JSON encoded. They only use single letter names, which makes it hard to understand but reduces the total amount of space per message. Luckily, the iOS SDK documented them in a single file.\nI'll use the following format in this article:\n\nThe original name of the field is denoted in brackets (e.g. t for [t]ype)\nValues that are not fixed are denoted with &lt;...&gt; (e.g. &lt;data_msg&gt;)\nFixed values will be shown as strings or numbers.\n\nThe JSON message is wrapped in a data message envelope, which is used to send arbitrary data messages to the server.\n\n\nThe data message will always have the following format. If the data message is a response, the action field is excluded. The request number is a sequential number used to match requests and responses.\n\n\nThe total body for each message, looks like this:\n\nFor the sake of readability, only the body will be shown in the following examples.\nAuth Request\n\n  Metadata\n\nAction: auth\n\n\n\nTo be able to operate on the database, you need to authenticate. The permissions and paths can be configured for every Firebase project in a database.rules.bolt file.\nThe body contains the id_token generated via the Firebase REST API (see next section), which looks like this:\n\nThe response includes the user_id, id_token and other information. Only the user_id is needed for further requests.\n\nSign in anonymously\nFirebase uses OpenID Connect for authentication. The anonymous provider is used to sign in anonymously. To generate an id_token and refresh_token, we can use the Firebase Auth REST API.\n\nWe need to modify the referer header, otherwise our request will be blocked. This is a security feature, but can be easily bypassed. Fun fact: The referer header can't be set in a browser (which is probably a good thing).\nThe response will contain the id_token which can be used to authenticate:\n\nExchange Refresh Token\nThe id_token is valid for one hour. To get a new one, we can exchange the refresh token as specified in the documentation.\n\nListen Request\n\n  Metadata\n\nAction: q\n\n\n\n\nThe listen request is used to query the database. It will return the current value and all future updates. All constants related to queries can be found in the iOS SDK again.\nThe body contains the following fields:\n\npath: The path to the data you want to query\nquery: An object with custom queries you want to execute (optional)\ntag: Unique number used to identify the query (optional)\nhash: Hash of the query. Always empty.\n\n\nThe response will contain the current value and all future updates. The data field will contain the JSON as it's stored in the database or null if not found.\n\nExample: Query party information\nWe can find all the information about a party with the following request:\n\nThe response contains all the information about the party (playback status, settings, etc.):\n\nExample: Query all parties\nQuerying a single party is cool, but can we dump all of them? Yes, we just have to change the path:\n\nThis returns all the parties ever created:\n\nWe can use jq to analyze the data. 279.669 parties have been created since the launch of Festify in 2017. The top country is Germany, followed by the US and Brazil.\n\nMost of them seem to be used for private parties, which can be seen by some of the names (Parents at my age: \"gRoWiNg/eVoLvInG FaMiLy\", Me: tell your cat I said pspsps is my personal favorite). Some of them are even used for weddings, prayers and company parties. Out of the 119.719 unique names the majority (80.767) are only used once. Most people use the default name Today's Party, followed by some power users:\n\n37.592 parties have been created in the last year. Barely any of them are playing music, which makes sense since most of them are private parties.\nExample: Query tracks of a party\nWhat if we want to know the tracks in the queue of a party? Easy, just change the path and that's it.\n\nThis returns a list of all tracks in the queue (including the fallback tracks).\n\nPut Request\n\n  Metadata\n\nAction: p\n\n\n\nReading data is cool and all, but what if we want to change something? We can use the put requests to change the data in the database. Depending on the path, the permissions can be different. When in doubt, check the database.rules.bolt.\nThe message contains the path again and the data that should be stored.\n\nThe response will just contain the status field:\n\nExample: Vote for song\nThe following request will add a new song to the database.\n\nTo withdraw your vote, you can send the same request with d set to null.\n\nPutting it all together\nWe learned how to authenticate, query and modify data in the database. These are all the building blocks we need to automate the process of voting for songs. I decided to write a Flutter app, to do exactly that and it worked like a charm!\n\n\n  \n  Adding the song:\n    \n      \n      Your browser does not support the video tag.\n    \n  \n  \n    The result:\n    \n      \n      Your browser does not support the video tag.\n    \n  \n\nMitigation\nThe only way to prevent automated voting is to disable anonymous voting. Festify even provides such a setting, but it has not yet been enabled.\nThe reason is quite simple: You don't want to add too many unnecessary steps to the process of voting. Drunk people will most likely not want to enter their username and password just to add one song. The harder you make it to vote, the less people will vote.\nConclusion\nThis was a fun project and I learned a lot about Firebase.

The goal of this blog post is to keep you updated on the changes from the last 2 years.\nKernel Logging\nWhen I originally wrote Kernel Printing with Rust, I had never heard or used the log crate. It's very powerful and you should definitely use it instead of some custom macros.\nBy using the log crate, we can easily switch between a kernel logger or serial port logger.

For more information, visit  Kernel Driver with Rust in 2022.\nPreface\nI read the official Rust book already in the end of 2019 but never had a project idea. That's why I decided to rewrite one of my already existing C++ projects. A few months after I started I already gained lots of experience and began to wonder whether it's possible to rewrite my Windows Kernel Drivers in Rust. A quick search lead me to many unanswered questions and two Github repositories. One of these repositories is winapi-kmd-rs which is unfortunately really complicated and outdated. I almost gave up until I stumbled upon win_driver_example which made me realize that a lot has changed and that it's not even that hard. This post summarize what went wrong and what I learned.\nProject Setup\nI'll keep this example project simple but I recommend creating a workspace so you don't end up having one big project. I made this mistake and had to break it into multiple crates. I sat down and thought of a folder structure and split the project into 21 different crates. This might sound a bit overkill, but I really like having a crate for only one task. For example, I have log, string, nt and km-alloc crates which makes refactoring a lot easier and allows you to reuse those crates in other projects.\nWith that in mind, let's get started with a demo project. The first thing we need to do is setup our driver project with the command cargo new --bin driver and open it in the editor of your choice.\nRust provides lots of abstractions in the standard library which cannot be used in the kernel because it uses the Windows API behind the scenes. Thanks to the awesome language design, we can remove the standard library by specifying the #![no_std] attribute in main.rs.\n\nHowever, if you try to build the project, you'll get some errors:\n\nIt turns out, the standard library actually does all these things behind the scenes. So let's implement it ourself. The second error can be fixed quite easily by modifying the build profile. An explanation for this error can be found here.\n\nNow lets fix the first error. Just looking at the attribute name says a lot. When our program panics, an unrecoverable error occurs. Rust will unwind the stack, clean up the resources and show a nice error message. But in the kernel, there's no console and thus we have to handle these unrecoverable errors ourself.\n\nYou can try to build the project again but it won't work yet, because I didn't tell you everything. We are not compiling a binary, but actually a library. A dynamic link library (.dll) to be more precise. Rename your main.rs to lib.rs and add the following to your  Cargo.toml:\n\nWhen we try to build the project again we get a different error: LINK : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol _DllMainCRTStartup. When Rust calls the Visual Studio linker behind the scenes, it passes the parameters that would normally be used to compile a dll. Luckily, we can override those and define our custom entry point. For that, we need to create a file .cargo/config in our project.\n\nThese options should be relatively self-explanatory. The most important one is the /ENTRY option, where we can set our custom program entry point. If you don't understand some of these, you can look them up in the official documentation. The entry point would normally have also two parameters but I decided to leave them for the sake of simplicity.\n\nIf we try to build our project again, it finally works! You can find the output file in the driver\\target\\x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\\debug folder. Remember when I told you that we actually create a library? Well, unfortunately Rust has no option to rename the file extension to .sys. More information on how this restriction can be circumvented can be found below.\nIf that's a big deal for you, you can take a look at cargo-xbuild. I also started my project with it but eventually migrated away from it, because a change in cargo caused an assertion to fail. The usage is pretty straightforward and can also be found in the win_driver_example repository.\nLinker Settings\nIf you try to define and call kernel functions with our current project, it won't work because the linker can't find the libraries that define those functions. In order to get that to work, we need to extend the linker search path. Of course we could just hardcode the path in our application, but that's not really idiomatic. It turns out that Trantect did that already in one of their projects. If you take a look at the build script, you'll see that it searches the Registry to find the path to the kernel libraries (in my case C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\10\\lib\\10.0.18362.0\\km). Here's the code that is responsible for finding and setting the path.\n\nInteracting with the kernel\nAlright, we can run our Rust driver in the kernel, but that's basically useless since Rust doesn't have bindings to the kernel library. Luckily, Rust makes it easy to create bindings to non-rust code.\nSome people already decided to create bindings, but they are very limited and do not cover undocumented functions. The project with the best bindings is a fork of the official WinAPI rust bindings and has a feature/km branch. It can be found here.\nHowever, as I said before, sometimes there's no bindings available and we have to do it ourselves. Let's explore this with an example. Let's say you want to check if an address is valid. We can use the function MmIsAddressValid which checks for page faults on read or write operations.\nThe first thing we need to do is create the definition of our function.\n\nAs you can see, I also created a type alias PVOID. Do you need that? No, but I want to keep the function definitions as close as possible to the original to reduce the number of errors when copy-pasting the definitions from MSDN.\nAlright, how can we use this function? It's simple. Just call it with whatever parameters you'd like.\n\nIf you try to run this, it'll not work because println!() is a macro defined in the standard library. So let's create our own custom log macro.\n\nThis implementation is pretty straightforward. I decided not to create the definition for the function because the WinAPI crate already defines it. Moreover, I also added a prefix to all the messages. We also need to add the null byte (\\0) so that the kernel knows where our string ends. The parameter for this function is just *const u8 which is another way of saying \"please give me a pointer to character array a.k.a. string\" so we have to use the .as_ptr() function.\nAfter releasing this article, daniel5151 pointed out that this macro can be dangerous when used incorrectly. If you want to know more, check out his comment on Reddit.\nIf you have worked with drivers before, you'll certainly know that you don't pass ANSI strings to functions. Windows decided to use the 16-bit character alternative: Unicode strings. Why would they do that? Well, as you probably know ANSI strings have 8 bits per character. So we can have 2^8 (255) different characters which is isn't that much. A single UNICODE character is 16 bits and can be one of 2^16 (65536) characters. Fun fact: It turns out that some people even proposed to add Klingon.\nSo if we cannot pass ANSI strings, can we convert them? Of course we can, but it's a little tedious. The hard part is converting the 8-bit characters to 16-bit characters. I tried it multiple times but ended up using a crate for that: obfstr. I'm just passing the wide string (wchar *) via the obfstr::wide!() macro and create the UNICODE_STRING structure with it.\n\nAlright, let's go back to our example. We have finally everything that is needed to run it. We only need to adjust the format specification syntax and we are good to go.\n\nNow that we covered the basics, let's explore the advantages of Rust. The function PsLookupProcessByProcessId is used to get a pointer to the EPROCESS structure, but it also needs to be cleaned up using ObfDereferenceObject. If you use C you'd have to do that every time you want to return from the function.\n\nIn Rust, you can define a wrapper structure and organize everything nicely together. You can easily extend this structure and for example add a function to get the base address but that's out of scope of this post.\n\nNow comes the important part: We can use the Drop trait to automatically clean up the resources when the object goes out of scope.\n\nThis allows us to write the same code and we don't even have to care about cleaning up. We can even exit early if the process couldn't be found. Isn't it amazing?\n\nRun and sign\nSo we finished our driver but how do we run it? There's multiple ways. For example, you can enable testsigning mode by running bcdedit.exe -set testsigning on (requires Administrator privileges). After that, you need to sign your driver with a self-signed certificate. Visual Studio does this behind the scenes if you write a driver in C++ or C. We are going to use a tool called cargo-make to automate this task. After installing it with cargo install --force cargo-make you have to create a file called Makefile.toml with the following content.\n\nWe defined three tasks:\n\nbuild-driver: Builds the project either in debug or release mode.\nrename: Renames the .dll to .sys. We also specify ignore_errors just in case the file has already been renamed.\nsign: Creates a certificate (if not already done) and signs the driver. This task depends on the two previous steps build-driver and rename.\n\nAfter running cargo make sign or cargo make sign --profile production you can load the driver either from the command line or via the OSR Driver Loader. You can view the DbgPrint output with DebugView.\nThere's also various other ways of getting access to the kernel. Almost all of them require vulnerable drivers which can be abused to allocate kernel memory and call kernel functions. Widely known projects utilizing this technique are TDL, drvmap, kdmapper and many more. Because these projects are abusing vulnerabilities, loading your driver is not safe and might cause your computer to bluescreen.\nMistakes, errors and problems\nWrong data types\nRewriting structures in Rust can often be complicated and a lot of effort because Microsoft uses so many aliases for their types. That's why you have to be careful to choose the correct data types. I ended up writing a driver in C++ that just prints the size of a specific structure and compared it to be sure that I didn't mess it up.\nNo official bindings\nMicrosoft is certainly interested in using Rust for Safe Systems Programming and has recently released Rust bindings for C++/WinRT. The WinAPI Rust bindings are still managed by the community and do not include the Windows Kernel API. There's a fork available that started creating bindings but it's far from perfect. I wish to see more progress in the development of these bindings from Microsoft.\nLack of nostd crates\nRust has lots of useful crates that speedup software development quite a lot, but a large portion of these crates heavily rely on the standard library. I can understand the authors: It's often not worth the effort to invest more time for something that will hardly be used. However, I'm sure this will continue to improve as more people and companies are starting to recognize the advantages of Rust for embedded and systems programming.\nHeap allocations\nWhen I first started writing drivers in Rust, I thought it was simply not possible to use collections like Vec, String or HashMap but then I found this page in the Embedded Book. It certainly would have been nice to use these collections, but in the end it didn't really matter. I hardly ever needed them and didn't really notice a difference.\nConclusion\nUsing Rust for all kinds of projects is fun. No matter if you want to write a game in the browser using WASM, develop a CLI tool or whether you want to explore the depths of the kernel. Writing kernel drivers in Rust is certainly unusual but you can utilize the strong type system and for example the Drop trait to reduce the number of bugs at compile-time. The source code for the driver can be found here.\nIt has been a long time since I wrote a blog post, I hope you enjoyed reading it. I'd love to hear your thoughts and opinions about this topic.\nThanks for reading!\n","id":"https://liuguilin361.github.io/posts/kernel-driver-with-rust/","title":"Writing a kernel driver with Rust"},"https://liuguilin361.github.io/posts/kernel-printing-with-rust/":{"body":"Update: I recommend using the log and kernel-log crates for kernel logging. For more information, visit  Kernel Driver with Rust in 2022.\nPreface\nPrinting is important. If something doesn't work, you want to know why (e.g. by looking at the console output). When I first wrote the log macro for my kernel driver I didn't think much about the security. I just thought: \"Surely nobody will call it with the wrong format specifiers or the wrong number of arguments, because the usage is simple and straightforward\".\nAs you probably can guess, this is against all the principles of Rust. If you use unsafe you need to ensure that the implementation is safe. This way you can be sure that the driver will be fine when there are no compiler warnings.\nSo let's make it a little safer.\nDetermining the problem\nI already gave it away. The problem is the variadic function DbgPrint which does not verify whether you called it with the correct parameters. So there's no link between the arguments and format specifiers. Thus it would be possible to do something like this with our current implementation:\n\nIn the best case we just crash, but this can also be exploited and be a critical security vulnerability. In fact, this is exactly what Format String Attacks do. If you are interested in this topic, I recommend checking out the article Exploiting Format String Vulnerabilities from 2001.\nSolution 1\nHmm, so can't you just compare the format specifier count with the number of arguments? Well yes, but actually no. In order to better understand the reason behind this, here's the macro from the last post.\n\nWe could theoretically check the number of the format specifiers using something like .matches(\"%\").count(), but this is already flawed. We also need to check whether the format specifier even exists, as you can pass a percent sign whenever you want. As you can see, this gets complicated fast.\nAnother problem is the counting of the parameters as we are just accepting any TokenTree elements and pass it to DbgPrint.\nWe could just update the repetition to $($x:expr $(,)?)* but then we also need to somehow get the count. This requires some tricks, but luckily other people already thought about this.\nTo summarize: We would need to check for every possible use case which is really complex and error-prone. These checks also only happen at runtime so we need to think about how we would want to handle those errors. Do we panic? Do we just do nothing? Do we print an error message? This slows down development and testing drastically as there's no instant feedback from the compiler anymore.\nMaybe there's an easier way to do this.\nSolution 2\nWhen I posted the article Writing a kernel driver with Rust on Reddit, /u/daniel5151 pointed out that the log macro can be pretty dangerous.\nCard\n\nWhen I first looked at the source code of the mentioned library, I didn't realize that it was using the format_args macro. A short time later, czapek mentioned that I could use format_args which would allow me to replicate the printing macros of the standard library.\nAfter taking a closer look at the Github repository, I noticed that it was also using format_args so I decided to create a library for kernel drivers. Let's explore how this works.\nIf you would have access to the standard library, you could use ToString to convert the return value of the format_args macro. However, as the String type is not available in the core library, we cannot use that. A workaround for this would be the alloc crate, but I didn't like this approach as it requires a custom allocator and heap allocations. You might now wonder: Is it possible to convert it to &amp;str? Well, I'm glad you asked. Recently a new feature called fmt_as_str has been added, but as of the release date of this post, it's still fairly limited. Currently, you can only get the formatted string if it has no arguments. So if we also wanted to use arguments, we would have to use a hybrid approach:\n\nIf you look closely, you can see the to_string call, so we are back to zero. So is there any way that we can the formatted string slice? Let's look at the documentation of format_args! again. Maybe we missed something.\n\nThis macro produces a value of type fmt::Arguments. This value can be passed to the macros within std::fmt for performing useful redirection. All other formatting macros (format!, write!, println!, etc) are proxied through this one. format_args!, unlike its derived macros, avoids heap allocations.\n\nHmmm, so all these links are referencing the standard library. The reason behind this is probably to have all the documentation in one place as it is just reexporting it from the alloc crate (which actually reexports it from the core crate).\nThe only macro that exists in the core crate is write!. After reading the documentation, you'll quickly realize that it's quite similar to the format_args! macro. Instead of return fmt::Arguments it writes it to a buffer. There's one example that caught my eye.\n\nIt seems like we can use the Write trait to specify where we want to write to. In this example, we'll probably get the formatted string slice as a parameter for the write_str trait function. As I'm not 100% sure about that, I'm using the option to run the code sample on the Rust Playground by clicking on the Run button in the top right corner. When I adjust the source code to actually pass a parameter and print it, it works as expected.\n\nBut having to call write! whenever we want to log something to the console is pretty complicated. I'm sure there's a better way to do this. We can again look at the source code and try to understand how it works. Luckily it's just a simple wrapper that calls the write_fmt function with the return value of the format_args! macro.\n\nFinally! That's exactly what I was looking for. A way to use the result of format_args (which has the type fmt::Arguments). In this case, we just have to implement the Writer trait and create our own write_str function which then prints the formatted string. That's actually easier than I thought it would be.\nSo let's start by creating our structure and implement Write.\n\nIf you read the previous article, you'll notice that I'm not using the winapi crate. After I published the article I remembered that the ntapi crate exists. There's also a kernel feature which can be used in our driver. We can add the following to our Crates.toml and then we are good to go:\n\nOkay, but having to instantiate the KernelWriter structure and calling the methods whenever we want to print things is a lot of effort and kind of complicated. We can replicate macros like println! and dbg! but we should also create some helper methods that make using it easier.\n\nThe constructor and write_nl should be self-explanatory. When you see write_fmt and write_str you might wonder why those exist. Well, if you wanted to use the kernel writer and call the functions defined in the Write trait (like write_fmt or write_fmt), you would have to import the trait or call it directly.\nImporting the trait inside a macro won't work as it's possibly redefining it. The following code will fail with the error error[E0252]: the name Write is defined multiple times.\n\nWe could wrap the entire macro inside {} so we can import it for different scopes. I didn't like that approach, that's why I decided to just call the function directly. We could also just do that in the macro, but moving it to the structure reduces the amount of code we have to write.\nOkay, so we finished the writer implementation, now we can finally implement our macros. They are pretty straightforward. We can just create a new KernelWriter instance, call format_args and pass it to write_fmt.\n\nEverything that has been mentioned until here has already been implemented in the rust-libc-print project. When I was looking through the issues, I noticed that someone was asking about the dbg! macro as it hasn't been implemented yet. I wasn't sure if that's even possible, so I decided to take a look at the macro definition.\nIt turns out that it only uses the println! macro combined with file!, line! and stringify!. We can just copy the code, update the println! macro to use our custom macro and we are done. Pretty easy, right?\n\nAlright, let's use the logging crate in the existing driver project and add the following.\n\nWait, if you try to run it, it doesn't work? That's weird. Why does it work when using rust-libc-print but not for our implementation?\n\nAfter some time and looking at the output, I recognized patterns. Between the strings, there are non-printable bytes and at the end, there's û…Šÿÿ4. Wait a minute, does the writer not know where our strings end? That's it. The strings in rust are not null-terminated (\\0) so when we pass the string as a pointer to DbgPrint there's no way it can know where it ends.\nAlright, we know what's wrong but how can we fix it? Well, it's not that simple. Currently, we know the exact size of the string that needs to be printed so it can be allocated on the stack. If we wanted to add additional characters, there's no way to guarantee that we have enough space on the stack.\nTo get around this, we have to use a custom allocator. I really tried to avoid it, but it seems like it's the only way. I decided to create a crate so that other people can also use it.\nThe implementation is simple and straightforward. We just need to implement the GlobalAlloc trait. You also need to implement the definitions and an allocation error handler, which have been left out for the sake of simplicity.\n\nIf you want to use the allocator in your project, you have to define a global allocator. If you are developing a library, you don't need to do that. You can just specify that you need to use the alloc crate and if someone tries to use this library without an allocator, an error will be shown. If you want to use the library, you have to add the following code:\n\nNow that we can allocate memory on the heap, we have to think about the best way to utilize this. Because the strings passed to the DbgPrint function are the primary problem, we can just append the null terminator.\n\nLet's try to run our example driver again. Awesome, it works!\n\nSolution 3\nThe previous implementation is pretty complicated and can be simplified now that we are using an allocator anyway. Instead of using format_args! and then passing the result to core::fmt::Write, we can just directly call format!. This would then look something like this:\n\nI decided to update the __kernel_println function so that we can pass both &amp;str and String but still append the null-terminator. This way we can easily pass the output of format! without having to update the already written code. Using Into&lt;String&gt; also reduces the number of allocations because only string slices (&amp;str) need to be converted.\n\nConclusion\nThis post basically only exists because I was lazy I thought that it's just a proof of concept, that the usage is clear and that I can worry about the safety later. Even though I was only playing around, I should have implemented it properly in the first place to spare me the trouble later on. I hope you learned something from my mistakes.\nAn example utilizing the kernel-print crate can be found in the kernel-driver-with-rust repository.\nShoutout to /u/daniel5151 and czapek for recognizing the problem and providing helpful information, resources and examples.\nThanks for reading!\n","id":"https://liuguilin361.github.io/posts/kernel-printing-with-rust/","title":"Kernel printing with Rust"},"https://liuguilin361.github.io/posts/mechanical-keyboard/":{"body":"Preface\nA friend of mine recently brought up his custom mechanical keyboard while we were hanging out in voice chat, and at first, nobody understood why anyone would buy one. At that time, I had no clue that there are entire communities about building custom keyboards. With every sentence that was said, we got deeper into this community. We explored different YouTube channels, watched comparisons, and listened to sound tests.\nOnly a few hours later, all of us were hooked and wanted to build our own keyboards as well. This post will go over all the parts that are needed, what they are for, and what you need to watch out for.\nParts\n\nThere aren't that many parts. It's just the:\n\nKeyboard base (bottom)\nKeycaps (top left)\nSwitches (top right)\n\nAlright, let's get started!\nKeyboard Base - Gamakay LK67\n\nThe most important part of your setup is the keyboard base. It'll define what your keyboard will look like. Depending on what you need and like, you can choose different sizes, materials, and features.\nAs you can see, it's a 65% keyboard (size reference) with a physical volume slider. The reason I wanted this keyboard, was not the volume slider but the Bluetooth support. I already have a wireless mouse (G502 Lightspeed) and I didn't want to make my cable management even worse than it already is. I also want to easily be able to take the keyboard with me (e.g. to the university campus). And, most importantly, it makes literally every setup look very clean and minimalistic. More on that later on.\nWhen building a mechanical keyboard, you have two options for the keyboard base:\n\nBuy the parts individually and solder them yourself\nBuy an already assembled keyboard base\n\nObviously, when buying all the parts individually, you have a lot more control over your build, but it also requires more tools and work. However, since I don't have a soldering iron, I was fine with buying an already assembled keyboard base.\nThings to watch out for:\n\nANSI vs ISO keyboard layout: The differences between these layouts are very subtle and only affect very few keys. This is a good image, that shows how the Return and Shift keys differ. Why this is important will be explained in the keycaps section.\nBluetooth support: Bluetooth on a mechanical keyboard isn't that popular, so you'll have fewer options to choose from. However, if you don't find a base that suits you, you can always buy the parts individually and assemble the base yourself.\nKeyboard size: Make sure to pick the correct size. Even when you don't have certain keys (e.g. F1-F12 or ~), you can still press them with a shortcut. On my keyboard, I can press F1 with Fn+1 or ~ with Fn+Shift+Esc. Most keyboards have separate software where you can remap these keys or add additional macros.\n\nSwitches - Akko Rose Red\n\nThe keyboard switches will define what your keyboard sounds and feels like, so it's essential that you pick them carefully.\nThere are three switch categories:\n\nLinear: Smooth and consistent actuation.\nTactile: Great feedback.\nClicky: Like tactile, but with an additional click sound.\n\nYou should know the operating force metric. It defines how much force you need to fully press the key. In my case, the switches have $43gf \\pm 5gf$ operating force. So they are much lighter compared to the $60gf$ operating force of my previous keyboard. There are also force travel graphs, which you can use to better understand how much the switch travels when it's pressed. For a much deeper explanation, I suggest reading this awesome article.\nSo how do you choose the switches? If you have the option, try them out in person. Either go to a store or find someone who has a mechanical keyboard. Otherwise, look for reviews on YouTube (or Invidious). You can compare the operating force and force travel with your current keyboard. Also, don't forget to listen to sound tests (both lubed and unlubed) because you don't want a keyboard that sounds terrible.\nThings to watch out for:\n\nTactile vs Linear: Choosing the correct switch type is important for the sound, feeling, and performance.\nLubed vs Unlubed: Lubing the switches will result in a smoother and much more satisfying sound. It's purely subjective but, in my opinion, totally worth it.\nAmount of switches in one set: Switches are often sold in smaller amounts. For example, one Akko Rose Red set contains 45 switches, but the keyboard has more keys. So to fill an entire keyboard, you need to buy another set.\n\nKeycaps - Akko\n\nNow we come to the fun part. Just like the keyboard base defines the raw layout, the keycaps are the polish. You can go wild when choosing them. Do you want a keyboard with only pink/white/blue/red/green keycaps? Or blank keycaps without letters? Or keycaps that sound and look like you can eat them? Or maybe keycaps that are built for RGB lighting? You could even mix all the aforementioned keycaps if that's what you want (please don't actually do that).\nThings to watch out for:\n\nANSI vs ISO keyboard layout: As previously explained, you want to make sure that your keycaps have the correct sizes (e.g. for the enter or shift key). In my case, they included both layouts but it might be different in other sets.\nProfiles: The profile is the overall shape of the keycap. They can change the style and feel of your keyboard.\nMaterial: Make sure to buy keycaps that use PBT instead of ABS plastic. PBT keycaps are usually higher quality, more durable, and wear down less over time. This is a good article about the differences.\n\nLube - Krytox 205g0\n\nWhen I first heard about lubing, I thought that it was a joke. It just sounded so surreal that anyone would lube switches just to make them sound better. And then I heard the difference. So if you are already building a mechanical keyboard, spending a few bucks more on lube doesn't hurt.\nYou might now think, can you even hear a difference? Well, let's try it out. One of these two recordings contains an unlubed key and one contains a lubed key.\nRecording 1Recording 2\n\n\nCould you hear the difference? Which one do you think is the lubed one and which is the unlubed one?\n\n  Answer\nIf you said left is lubed and right is unlubed, then you are correct. :)\n\n\nSo how exactly does lubing work? First, you need to disassemble the switch (not the code this time :P). In my case, I had to put the switch into the gray thing. It was quite difficult to take apart the first switch, but you'll quickly get a feeling for it.\n\n\n\nOn the right, you can see the upper housing, stem, spring, and bottom housing. Each of these need to be lubed individually. Here's a good article that has an in-depth explanation of everything you need to do. You can also just look up a video that explains how you can lube your switch type.\nThings to watch out for:\n\nLess is more: When applying the lube, don't overdo it! You can always come back later on and apply more, but it's much harder the other way around.\nAccessories: Splitting the switches into separate parts can be quite tricky. I can recommend spending a few more bucks on lube that comes with the required tools.\nClicky, Linear, and Tactile switches: It's not recommended to lube clicky switches because you can accidentally convert them to tactile switches and destroy their unique sound. You can lube tactile switches, but it's generally recommended to use thin lube so you don't remove a lot of the tactile bump. Whereas, when lubing linear switches, you can do nothing wrong. They are already smooth and consistent, lube will only make them smoother and remove most of the rattling sound.\nTime: I completely underestimated the amount of time it takes to lube all the switches. You can roughly calculate the required time by multiplying the time it takes you to lube one switch, with the total switch amount. For example, I started around 8 PM and finished lubing all the switches around 2 AM. So it took me about 4-5 minutes to lube one switch. While this might sound like a lot, just hop on a call with your friends or watch a movie and the time will fly by.\n\nAssembling everything\nNow that we know what each part is for, we can put it all together. It's not that complicated, the pseudocode for it looks something like this:\n\nSound Comparison\nMy old keyboard was the Razer Ornata Chroma which I bought in July 2018. I didn't have any complaints about this keyboard up until I learned about custom mechanical keyboards. Here's what it sounds like:\n\nAnd here's a sound test on my new custom mechanical keyboard:\n\nCan you hear the difference? I still can't believe that I've been using the Razer keyboard for the last four years. Now that I can compare it against something, it sounds absolutely terrible. It also feels very inconsistent and has a much higher operating force.\nPrice\nAlright, let's talk about money. In total, I spent around 160€ on the keyboard:\n\nKeyboard base: 55€\nSwitches: 40€\nKeycaps: 50€\nLube: 15€\n\nAnd it was worth it in my opinion. As a programmer, I spend a lot of time on the computer, so why not make it more enjoyable?\nAlso, don't get scared if you don't want to spend this much money, because there are cheaper alternatives. You could get keycaps for 25€, switches for 40€ (these are the same switches I have) and a keyboard base for 45€. In total, that's 110€. And that keyboard is arguably even better than what you get for the same or higher price when buying \"gaming keyboards\".\nConclusion\n\nShould you build a custom mechanical keyboard?\n\nFeeling and sound: I've been using mine for a few weeks now and I don't want to go back. I love the feeling and sound of my keyboard. I even regularly go on MonkeyType, not to improve or test my writing speed, but because I enjoy typing on it.\nCustomizability: You can easily swap the switches, keycaps, or even the keyboard base. There are even people that add extra foam to further dampen the sound.\nDurability: If you are a heavy typer, switches of mechanical keyboards will usually last longer than the average membrane keyboard. And even if something breaks, you can easily replace it.\nFun: Building and customizing a mechanical keyboard is a fun project.\n\nIf you spend lots of time in front of a computer, you should definitely build a mechanical keyboard. Trust me, you won't regret it. Feel free to reach out if you have any further questions or comments.\nThanks for reading!\n","id":"https://liuguilin361.github.io/posts/mechanical-keyboard/","title":"Building my first mechanical keyboard"},"https://liuguilin361.github.io/posts/rust-kernel-adventures/":{"body":"Preface\nI'm currently writing an AMD hypervisor in Rust and there I need to allocate memory for lots of different structures. And not all of them use the same memory, so I decided to create a helper structure to allocate and deallocate it for me.\nMy Implementation\nMy implementation has 2 different types:\n\nNormal: non-paged pool memory allocated with ExAllocatePoolWithTag\nContiguous: physical memory allocated with MmAllocateContiguousMemorySpecifyCacheNode\n\nThe first implementation looked like this:\n\nDoesn't look too complicated, huh? That's exactly what I thought, but there is one big problem with this. Can you spot it?\nLet's look at the following example code:\n\nNow, what do you think happens at the end of the scope?\n\nBoth allocations will be dropped and deallocated\nOnly bar will be dropped and deallocated\nOnly foo will be dropped and deallocated\nNothing will be deallocated\n\nYou might have guessed it. Answer 3 is correct. What happens to bar? It's simple: Because we aren't capturing T inside AllocatedMemory, the compiler thinks it can drop the allocation immediately. For some reason, the compiler even optimized the pointer to 0x0, so if you run the code, the driver would crash due to an access violation (\n0xffffffffc0000005) because we are passing a null pointer to ExFreePool/MmFreeContiguousMemory. We can't just add a check for it, because then we would be leaking memory.\nHere's what I think is happening:\n\nIn the disassembly, it looked like this. You can see the allocation with MmAllocateContiguousMemorySpecifyCacheNode and then in the last lines it immediately tries to deallocate it.\n\n\nThis bug was driving me insane because I didn't know what was causing it. I tried so many different things that didn't work:\n\nDisabled all unneeded features\nDisabled LTO (link-time-optimization)\nTried a ton of different compilation\nRemove AllocType, to check if it was a compiler bug/optimization\nReplaced NonNull&lt;T&gt; with *mut T\n\nAfter none of my fixes worked, I decided to consult the Rust Nomicon. Unfortunately, that didn't solve my problems either. I learned about tricky scenarios and common mistakes again, but none of them helped me figure out a solution.\nLooking at existing implementations\nI already knew about Box&lt;T&gt; and Vec&lt;T&gt;, so I wondered how they are implemented behind the scenes because they work similarly.\nVec&lt;T&gt;\nVec&lt;T&gt; is backed by RawVec which uses Unique&lt;T&gt; for the data pointer. Unique&lt;T&gt; is a wrapper around NonNull&lt;T&gt;, but it behaves as if it was an instance of T. That's exactly what we want.\n\nThe Drop implementation also uses #[may_dangle] to assert that the destructor of a generic type is guaranteed to not access any expired data. You can read more about that in the Rust Nomicon - An Escape Hatch.\n\nI tried both implementing Unique&lt;T&gt; and #[may_dangle], but that didn't solve my problem.\nBox&lt;T&gt;\nThis one is much simpler because it's just a Unique&lt;T&gt; pointer (so it asserts that Box owns the data).\n\nThere are many different allocator implementations, but I was only interested in one thing: the Drop implementation. I thought: \"Maybe they do some black magic, to make sure that the inner elements are dropped correctly\". And yes, they do, because there's literally nothing.\n\n\nSince none of my previous attempts worked, I tried to replace AllocatedMemory&lt;T&gt; with Box&lt;T&gt;, but it still didn't work. I tried a few different examples and figured out the problem.\nHere's the what the structures look like:\n\nFor example, this code works:\n\nYet these two examples don't work:\n\n\nBox::new_zeroed() refers to the MaybeUninit::zeroed() documentation, which mentions the following:\n\nNote that dropping a MaybeUninit&lt;T&gt; will never call T's drop code. It is your responsibility to make sure T gets dropped if it got initialized.\n\nSo it is actually not the Rust compiler that's wrong, it's me. I'm still not sure why my AllocatedMemory implementations were not working, but I now know that lots of effort has been put into making Box&lt;T&gt; sound and safe.\nFinal solution\nWhile going through the source code of Box&lt;T&gt; I also noticed the new allocator api. Because I needed to redesign the AllocatedMemory structure, I decided to use Box with custom allocators instead.\nI already have a global allocator which allocates pool memory, so I only need to write one for physical memory. We only have to implement the Allocator trait, and we are good to go:\n\nNow we can either pass alloc::Global or PhysicalAllocator to the functions like this:\n\nInstead of passing alloc::Global (the global allocator) to Box::new_in, we can also just use the default implementation Box::new.\n\nThere's even fallible allocations if you want to handle the allocation errors yourself. Box::new_in is just a wrapper around Box::try_new_in and calls handle_alloc_error(layout) upon failure.\n\nSo now, instead of using AllocatedMemory&lt;T&gt;, we can use Box&lt;T&gt; and get rid of all the bugs and crashes.\nConclusion\nI actually really like this change. We can reuse existing implementations and allocate it wherever we want. We also reduced the amount of code we have to manage and other people can understand the code more easily.\nI also think I'd have a hard time trying to implement Drop myself when Box is using the compiler for that. There's probably a good reason for that. If you know why, please let me know.\n\nThanks for reading.\n","id":"https://liuguilin361.github.io/posts/rust-kernel-adventures/","title":"Custom Allocators in Rust"},"https://liuguilin361.github.io/posts/second-year-of-uni/":{"body":"It's been a year since I wrote the blog post about my first year of university. It was truly life-changing, and I didn't think it could get any crazier... but it did.\nMeta: I was thinking for a long time about whether or not I should even release this publically, or if I should just keep it in my private Obsidian vault. I value privacy and am often overthinking whether or not to share information. I see social media as a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it can be great for building an audience and connecting but it can also be the source of comparison and unhappiness.\nI've realized that the benefits outweigh the downsides. Even if just one person decides to go to university because of this post, I see it as an absolute win. University changed my life, so why can't it change yours?\nWhat happened?\n0xA Science Association\nA few friends and I founded an association called 0xA and organized multiple events throughout the year. It started small with around 30 people coming to our kickoff event, but then we ended up organizing an event with more than 100 attendees. As one of the organizers and photographers of the events, I feel proud when I go to our website and look through the pictures of our past events.\n\nMoving out\nI would have never believed, how much this changed my life. I always had the assumption that living near the university is a waste of money because you can stay at home and live rent-free. Sure, you might have to commute every day, but you can still use the time productively. I spent the 3 hours of travel time per day often reading, writing in my journal, or working on university assignments. Yet I still think I wasted a lot of time.\nLiving directly next to the university brings a lot of benefits I hadn't thought about:\n\nYou can go to pretty much every meetup or party and leave whenever you want. Before I either had to sleep at a friend's place or catch the last train at 10PM.\nBeing physically close to friends allowed spontaneous meetups or talks until 3AM in the morning after the party.\nMy university dorm had a really active community. There were cafe chats, bar nights, regular tables, and events throughout the year. I met a lot of interesting people there.\nYou'll be in a completely new environment where you can decide how you want to live your life. This gave me a sense of control over my life, which was truly inspiring. I also tried out a lot of new things, which I probably wouldn't have done if I was still living at home.\n\nGym\nI also started going to the gym more often. It all started when I was doing a few push-ups every day in July 2022, which turned into a habit pretty quickly. I noticed that I was getting stronger, which was motivating. At that time, I didn't really focus on my diet but I had fun and built some muscle which made me more confident.\nDancing\nI never really learned how to dance, until I decided to sign up for Hip Hop / Urban Dance classes with two friends. And it didn't only change my confidence and life at parties, but also outside of that. These dance classes taught me how to vibe to the music, while not caring about what others think.\nOne time at a party, I saw a girl dancing and was fascinated by her moves. A friend of mine told me that it's called shuffle dancing. I was excited to learn it as well and did so one step at a time. It was really hard and bad in the beginning, but I stuck with it. I even convinced a friend to start learning it as well. It was so much fun just doing our thing at the parties, not caring about what others think about our mediocre dance moves.\nI also love the shuffle community. I can't tell you how many times someone randomly came up to me at a party and then started to join me shuffle dancing. I got compliments about my dance moves and got to meet new people. It's a great icebreaker, but most importantly, it's a lot of fun and great cardio! :D\nMeetups\nLinz is the home to many meetups, ranging from DevOps to JavaScript. I went to almost all of them, and it was totally worth it. You learn about new technologies or projects (e.g. plaintextaccounting or how to create self-hosted and self-styled vector maps) and have the opportunity to meet like-minded people.\nAnd there's always free food and drinks :P\nTaking more pictures videos\nI want to document my life so that I can look back and see what I have been up to. I've been taking a lot of pictures, but then a friend of mine convinced me to take videos instead. Why? Videos contain a lot more information and are more entertaining to watch. You can also hear background noise (music in a club, birds in nature, or maybe just cars) which is not a thing in pictures. Pictures only capture parts of a moment, while videos let you experience everything about that moment again.\nUniversity\nMost of the lectures I took weren't that interesting, but I had 3 highlights:\n\nNetworks Anonymity: Learned about Tor, I2P, Nym and Freenet.\nAdvanced Operating Systems: Learned about operating systems and hardware interaction, drivers, modern scheduling\nand memory management algorithms in Linux.\nFunctional Programming: Learned about functional programming with OCaml, reasoning, efficiency, type checking, and type inference.\n\nTo sleep or not to sleep?\nI conducted an experiment by accident: Is it better to focus on sleep at the cost of university, or vice versa?\nI read Why We Sleep and realized how important sleep is, but I think I overestimated it a little bit. In the winter semester, I focused on getting 8 hours of sleep. So if I had a lecture at 8:30 and I went to bed at 2:00, then I wouldn't go to the lecture because I would wake up at 10:00. Because of this, I missed a lot of lectures and had a really bad sleep schedule.\nI tried to do the opposite in the summer semester: Go to all lectures, no matter how much sleep I got. Even if I only get 5 hours of sleep, I still go to the lecture. Because of this, staying up actually had a consequence which made me go to bed earlier. And it's still better to go to the lecture tired than to not even show up.\nOther highlights\n\nSpoke at a local meetup\nJoined the students union for computer science\nApplied for an exchange semester and got accepted\nWent to my first festival. It was a lot of fun!\nTravelled with friends in the summer\nMet many new people\n\nFinal Words\nWhile I am writing this, I already started my third year of university with an exchange semester in Groningen. The last month has already been an incredible experience, I can only wonder where I'll be in a year.\nIf you found this type of blog post interesting, let me know. I'm currently thinking about writing more about personal experiences and life lessons.\nAs always, thanks for reading!\n","id":"https://liuguilin361.github.io/posts/second-year-of-uni/","title":"Reflecting on the second year of Uni"},"https://liuguilin361.github.io/posts/why-java-doesnt-optimize/":{"body":"It was a nice monday evening, and I decided to take a look at the feedback of my university homeworks. More specifically, the feedback of my compiler construction homework. I got around 95-100% on the exercises, so I can't complain. But one thing caught my eye.\nI got this feedback on my last exercise: you create a complete new boolean in each loop -&gt; inefficient -1. I wasn't sure what this comment was referring to, so I had to look it up (thankfully they added the line numbers).\nThe code looks like this:\n\nI'll explain a little bit of the context. This code is part of the compiler we are currently writing in the Compiler Construction lecture. We are building our own compiler for a language called MicroJava. It has similar syntax compared to Java, but is much easier and more minmalistic.\nAn important part of compiler construction is the error handling and that's exactly what this method does. When the user enters an invalid method declaration (for example void foo[);) then we want to find a point where we can safely continue again. In this case, we are looking for eof (end of the program), void (a new method declaration) or type (a new function with return value). There's also the method calls tab.find() (just looks up the symbol in the symbol table) and sym.name(), but they are not important.\nDon't worry if you didn't understand everything, that's not the focus of this blog post.\nSo when I read the feedback and saw this code snippet, I remembered that I didn't inline it, because I thought that the Java Compiler surely has some optimizations passes that will do that for me.\nSince I have lots of experience with compiled languages like Rust and C++, I assumed that the compiler will just inline the variables for me. I knew that Java had massive performance problems in the early version and that they fixed them later. I also have some experience with LLVM and compiler optimization, so I presumed that they just implemented something similar.\nBecause of that, I wanted to prove that it doesn't matter whether I create new variables or not.\n\nSince I have reverse engineered Android apps and other Java applications before, I wasn't scared of digging into the Java Bytecode. Luckily, that wasn't necessary. I could compile the project to a .jar and open it in JD-GUI.\nThe decompiled code from above looks like this:\n\nLooks pretty similar, huh? For comparison, the disassembly for the inlined version looks like this:\n\nThat looks more like it. Even when comparing the Java bytecode, I can clearly see the differences.\nBecause of that, I began thinking about another scenario:\nMaybe something else had happened. Maybe the Java Compiler noticed the function calls tab.find() and sym.name() and didn't follow them. So if the compiler doesn't know about what the function does inside, it can't change the control flow. Because what if the function tab.find() also increases a counter timesCalled internally? If we inline it, it might not get called.\nLet's think about this with an example. If modifySomethingInternally modifies some variable internally (or calls other functions that do that), then the compiler can't inline it, because if a is already true then this function would never get called.\n\nYou might have noticed that I used || instead of &amp;&amp; like in the example above here. Sadly, this doesn't change anything, because the compiler still can't inline it. Why? Because if a is false, then you don't even need to consider the alternative cases.\n\nThis brings up an important question: If this was truly the case, why didn't the compiler inline isVoid and isEof? With the reasoning from above, the compiler should easily be able to figure out that these variables are used nowhere else.\nNot knowing where to continue, I wanted to try one more thing. We've been using Java 8 for our compiler, so I thought that maybe a newer compiler might have better optimizations. I couldn't have been more wrong. I tried to compile it with Java 16 and compared the bytecode and decompiled code again and it didn't change a thing.\nSo it really seems like Java doesn't do any optimizations. This would also explain why the decompilers are working so good.\nAt this point, I even thought: \"Maybe this is the reason why Java is so slow\".\n\nBecause I failed to prove my point, I decided to go to a place where I could potentially find answers: the Internet.\nI found this Stackoverflow post, which showed cases where JIT offers better performance than static compilation. Some optimizations that are only feasible at runtime are:\n\nJust in Time Compilation that uses processor specific features like SIMD.\nCollect statistics about how the program runs in the environment and optimize based on that. (Note: Profile-guided optimization does the same)\nRearrange code for better cache utilization.\nGlobal code optimizations (e.g. inlining of library functions) without losing the advantages of dynamic linking and without the overheads inherent to static compilers and linkers\n\nWhile these features sound exciting at first, I'm sure that you can achieve just as good performance using a statically compiled language. The first point is already available in almost all compilers and the only hurdle is the distribution, since you either need to distribute multiple binaries or use something like multiversion to compile multiple implementations of a function based on the available cpu features.\nI found another post that explained more about the optimizations in the Java Compiler. Turns out, there aren't any (or at least only very simple ones). The posts made it very clear, that the JIT compiler is actually much better than I thought:\n\nThe point is that the JIT compiler does most of the optimization - and it works best if it has a lot of information, some of which may be lost if javac performed optimization too. If javac performed some sort of loop unrolling, it would be harder for the JIT to do that itself in a general way - and it has more information about which optimizations will actually work, as it knows the target platform.\n\n\nI'm on the one hand fascinated that the JIT compiler can achieve such great performance, but also a little disappointed that they abstract so much information away. At the end, it's basically a black box where you have few options to figure out how to profile or optimize your code. I guess that's good enough for most people.\nBeing able to pop the binary into the binary in IDA or Binary Ninja and see the code that will be executed by the processor is something that I've really liked in languages like Rust or C++. There are also much more tools around to help with that, so I guess I could also be biased.\n\nSo did I prove my point? Not really, but I'm not so sure that the feedback is really correct. It clearly mentions the inefficiency of my code and not the size on disk. So the speed only depends on the JIT compilation. I'm sure I could profile the function, but I'm not sure if that will even show great differences in the performance. Why? Because the first rule of optimization is: Don't bother optimizing one-time costs. So unless you have hundreds of invalid method declarations in your code, the function will either get called very little or even never.\n\nDid I really just spend 3 hours writing this blog post because of -1 point out of 24? Maybe.\n","id":"https://liuguilin361.github.io/posts/why-java-doesnt-optimize/","title":"Why Java doesn't
